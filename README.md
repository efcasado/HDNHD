# Not a Hotdog (NAH)

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is inspired by the [Boombox "not hot dog" example](https://hexdocs.pm/boombox/examples.html#not-hot-dog).

A toy experiment to show how to build an Slack app and how to use the Bumblebee library to classify images.

This project is meant to be used for educational purposes only and it would not have been possible without the amazing
work from the [Bumblebee](https://github.com/elixir-nx/bumblebee) and
[Slack Elixir](https://github.com/ryanwinchester/slack_elixir) libraries.
